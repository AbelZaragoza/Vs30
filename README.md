This repository is part of my PhD research and contains a deep learning model designed to predict the VS30 parameter (average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 meters of the Earth's crust) using neural networks. The project includes the trained model, associated datasets, and code for applying the model to predict VS30 in new regions.
